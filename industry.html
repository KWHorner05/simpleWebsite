        <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
        <p>
            "The healthcare industry focuses on preventing illness, treating patients,
            and improving overall quality of life. It includes hospitals, clinics,
            insurance providers, medical technology companies, and public health organizations.
            Healthcare is essential because it directly impacts the safety and well-being of society."
        </p>

        <h2>Career of Interest</h2>
        <p>
            "A career that interests me within healthcare is working as a healthcare IT specialist.
            This role involves managing medical software, electronic health records,
            and supporting the technology that healthcare professionals rely on every day.
            It is appealing because it blends technology with helping others."
        </p>

        <h2>Ethical Issues in the Industry</h2>
        <p>
            "One major ethical issue in healthcare is protecting patient privacy.
            Medical professionals and IT staff handle sensitive personal and medical data.
            If this information is mishandled or accessed without permission,
            it can harm patients and damage trust in healthcare systems."
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Values and Ethical Response</h2>
        <p>
            "My personal values such as integrity, accountability, and respect guide how
            I would respond to ethical challenges. These values encourage me to follow laws,
            protect confidential information, and report unethical behavior rather than ignore it."
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
        <p>
            "Healthcare organizations are common targets for cyberattacks like ransomware,
            phishing, and data breaches. These attacks are dangerous because they can shut down
            systems, expose patient data, and disrupt patient care."
        </p>

        <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
        <p>
            "Cybersecurity best practices in healthcare include strong passwords,
            multi-factor authentication, regular system updates, and employee training.
            Limiting access to sensitive data and encrypting patient information
            helps protect systems and maintain patient trust."
