        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Integrity means being honest, ethical, and consistent in my actions, even when no one is watching.
            This value comes from my upbringing and observing the trust built by people who keep their word.
            Integrity is important to me because it shapes my reputation and self-respect.
            Without integrity, relationships break down and trust becomes difficult to rebuild.
        </p>

        <h2>Hard Work</h2>
        <p>
            Hard work represents dedication, effort, and persistence in everything I do.
            This value derives from school, athletics, and personal experiences where effort directly impacted success.
            It is important because it pushes me to improve and achieve long-term goals.
            Without hard work, opportunities are wasted and potential remains unrealized.
        </p>

        <h2>Respect</h2>
        <p>
            Respect involves treating others with fairness, empathy, and consideration.
            I learned this value through family, teachers, and teamwork experiences.
            Respect is important because it strengthens communication and relationships.
            A lack of respect leads to conflict, misunderstanding, and division.
        </p>

        <h2>Accountability</h2>
        <p>
            Accountability means taking responsibility for my actions and their outcomes.
            This value comes from leadership roles and learning from mistakes.
            It is important because it encourages growth, trust, and personal development.
            Without accountability, blame replaces learning and progress becomes difficult.
